# IT5016D_Assessment 2 - Software Project

## Introduction

This project is a basic helpdesk application developed using Python. The application was made for the purpose of IT5016D Assessment 2 - Software Project. This was my first time using Python and was how I learned the basics of the language.

I had fun creating this project and learned a lot about Python. I enjoyed adding colour to the text with ANSI escape codes to add some style to the application.

When I first created the project it was very basic and after having it working correctly I kept going back and adding more input validation and error handling to make the application more robust. I maybe did that a few to many times but I enjoyed the process of making the application more robust and learning more about Python.

## Viewing the Project

It's recommended to use an application that supports ANSI escape codes othwrwise the text formatting will not be displayed correctly. The application has been tested using Python 3.11.3 in the following applications:

- PyCharm 2023.2.3
- Visual Studio Code 1.84.2

Download the repository, open Pycharm or Visual Studio Code, navigate to the project folder, and open the Software_Project.py file. Run the file to start the application.
