# Cat-Couture

## Introduction

This project is a website for a fictional cat clothing company called Cat Couture. The website is a dynamic website that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a Postgres SQL database. It was the final project I developed at Developers Institute.

The backend uses a repository design pattern to access the database. The backend is written in Node.js and uses Express.js as the web framework and PostgreSQL as the database.

The frontend uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The frontend uses React.js as the web framework.

This project was the first time I experimented with creating button animations which was a lot of fun. I used CSS to create the animations. I also used CSS to create the responsive design of the website. I also experimented with using absolute positioning to position elements on the page outside their containing div.
