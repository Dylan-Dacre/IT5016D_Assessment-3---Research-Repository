# particles.js

## Introduction

I've always been interested in web development and design. Oneday I came across [this website](https://whois.domaintools.com/) when looking for some domain information. I was instantly taken by the particle effect in the background. I knew that if I ever created a website I wanted to have a similar effect. When I then had an opportunity to create a website I knew I had to find out how to create this effect. After some research I found Particles.js

Particles.js is a lightweight JavaScript library for creating particles. It is a simple and easy to use library that can be used to create some amazing effects. I used this library to create the background on my Chatbot website.

It's a great display of the awesome things that can be done with JavaScript and I would highly recommend checking it out.

## Design Principles

- Clean Code > Clever Code

The library is designed to be simple and easy to use. The library is designed to be clean and easy to understand. While there are complex operations happening in the background the library is well commented to make it easy to understand. You can understand what is happening in each section of the code.
