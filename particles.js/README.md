# particles.js

## Introduction

I've always been interested in web development and design. Oneday I came across [this website](https://whois.domaintools.com/) when looking for some domain information. I was instantly taken by the particle effect in the background. I knew that if I ever created a website I wanted to have a similar effect. When I then had an opportunity to create a website I knew I had to find out how to create this effect. After some research I found Particles.js

Particles.js is a lightweight JavaScript library for creating particles. It is a simple and easy to use library that can be used to create some amazing effects. I used this library to create the background on my Chatbot website.

It's a great display of the awesome things that can be done with JavaScript and I would highly recommend checking it out.
