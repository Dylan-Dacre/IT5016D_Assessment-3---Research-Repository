# Weather.js

## Introduction

A cool little weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data for a city and displays it on the screen. This partly inspired my weather component in my capstone project. Sadly I didn't get the time to actually implement it. But I will be using this as a reference for when I do. The OpenWeatherMap API seems the way to go.

I really like this site/app as it shows what cool little sites/apps you can create with JavaScript. The code is very simple but you get a very pleasing result.
