# Weather.js

## Introduction

A cool little weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data for a city and displays it on the screen. This partly inspired my weather component in my capstone project. Sadly I didn't get the time to actually implement it. But I will be using this as a reference for when I do. The OpenWeatherMap API seems the way to go.

I really like this site/app as it shows what cool little sites/apps you can create with JavaScript. The code is very simple but you get a very pleasing result.

## Design Principles

- KISS

This project implements the KISS principle by keeping the code simple and easy to understand. There is no unnecessary code, it only has the code needed to get the weather data and display it on the screen.

- YAGNI

This project implements the YAGNI principle by only implementing the features needed to get the weather data and display it on the screen. There is no unnecessary features. You search for a city and it displays the weather data for that city.

- Single Responsibility Principle

This project implements the Single Responsibility Principle by making sure each function only has one responsibility. Each function only does what it is supposed to do. For example, the function to get the weather data only gets the weather data and does not do anything else. The function to display the weather data only displays the weather data and does not do anything else. The date function only gets the date and does not do anything else.

- Clean Code > Clever Code

This project implements the Clean Code > Clever Code principle by making sure the code is easy to read and understand. The code is very simple and easy to understand. There is no clever code that is hard to read and understand.
