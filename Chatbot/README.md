# Chatbot

## Introduction

This project is a chatbot that uses JavaScript to interact with the user. The chatbot asks the user a series of questions and then uses the answers to the questions to generate a response. The chatbot uses a decision tree to generate the response. The chatbot is a project I developed at Developers Institute.

The main code I developed for this project is in the \Submission\script.js file. The code in this file is used to generate the response from the chatbot. The code in the \Submission\index.html file is used to display the chatbot to the user. The code in the \Submission\style.css file is used to style the chatbot.

This is the first project I used the particles.js library in. I used the library to create the interactive particle background of the chatbot. The library is displayed later in the research repository.
