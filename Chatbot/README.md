# Chatbot

## Introduction

This project is a chatbot that uses JavaScript to interact with the user. The chatbot asks the user a series of questions and then uses the answers to the questions to generate a response. The chatbot uses a decision tree to generate the response. The chatbot is a project I developed at Developers Institute.

The main code I developed for this project is in the \Submission\script.js file. The code in this file is used to generate the response from the chatbot. The code in the \Submission\index.html file is used to display the chatbot to the user. The code in the \Submission\style.css file is used to style the chatbot.

This is the first project I used the particles.js library in. I used the library to create the interactive particle background of the chatbot. The library is displayed later in the research repository.

## Design Principles

- Open-Closed Principle

The chatbot is designed to be open for extension but closed for modification. The chatbot is designed to be extended by adding more questions and responses to the decision tree. The chatbot is designed to be closed for modification by using a decision tree to generate the response.

- Single Responsibility Principle

The chatbot is designed to have a single responsibility. The chatbot is designed to ask the user questions and generate a response based on the answers to the questions. The chatbot is not designed to do anything else.

- KISS

The code for the bot is very simple. The user input sets the value of a variable and then the value of the variable is used to find the response in the decision tree. Just a whole lot of IF statements!
